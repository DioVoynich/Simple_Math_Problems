React.js practice byproduct

A simple React.js HTML that gives simple mathmetical addition quesitons to the users, two positive number in the range of 0 to 100. 
If the user answer the question correctly, the score will be increased by 1, otherwise decreased by 1. 
I made this while I am learning JavaScript and React.js. So, I believe this small project can provide some clear idea of how the
declarative programming language works for people who also how interests in React.js. 

For playing the game, simply open the html file. If you want to see the source code, open the file by something like Notepad++, IDE, or
txt editor. Good luck for your learning and enjoy!
